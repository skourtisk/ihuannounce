# University Announcements App

This is a React Native application designed for students at the International Hellenic University. 
The app fetches announcements from the university's API and allows students to add tags to filter which announcements they want to see. 
It uses the university's authentication system for login.

## Features

- Fetch and display announcements from the IHU API.
- Filter announcements based on user-defined tags.
- Authenticate users using the IHU's authentication system.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js, npm, and Expo CLI installed on your machine. You can install Expo CLI using npm:

```
npm install -g expo-cli
```

Usage
After starting the development server, you can open the app in a web browser, on an Android emulator, or on a physical device using the Expo Go app.

The app will present a login page. After successful authentication, the user will be redirected to the home screen where they can view and filter announcements.
